Hi, I’m SuN4iK
I'm interested in writing application logic in Java, but I'm also trying my hand at other areas.
I’m currently learning java, html and css
I'm a pupil, 14 y.o, but I'm trying to learn what they don't teach in school.
I'm glad you visited my GitHub page, here you can watch my progress and check out my projects))
Have Fun!
Current projects:
